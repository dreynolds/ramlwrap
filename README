This is an example at the moment, not a fully fledged python package.

you need the ramlwrap module in your django project... copy and paste it in for now (tm)

and you need to make some exception middleware (not included) to catch the exception

Annnd you need of course, an app.

(pre - make a virtualenv, and install the pip list (pip install -r pip.list)

What i did to make this:


1) make a django project
2) copy the ramlwrap folder in
3) start a new app (python manage.py startsomeapp0
4) add that new app to the project/settings.py installed_apps
5) make a folder called raml and put your raml in.
6) now, in the project/urls, copy the template for my raml..

7) this bit reeats: write an api, and add the mapping for that in.

In the example/urls you can see ive mapped ONE function, but there are TWO in the raml - so one will return the example,
and one will return the result from the api i put into someapp.

notice i made a new module called API so i can put one per file in there to help with .. later...
